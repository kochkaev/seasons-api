# Seasons API

This mod was developed by analogy with the Spigot plugin "Seasons" specifically for the private Minecraft server "Zixa City" by its administrator (kochkaev, aka kleverdi). The idea of this mod was taken from Harieo.
Seasons API was developed for creating your own seasons, weathers and challenges!

## What is this?
+ Season - a certain period of a conditional year that has a certain weather for the current conditional time.
+ Weather - daytime conditions for the game that have their own Challenges.
+ Challenge - a set of some sort of rules for the player, appropriate to the current season and weather.

You can create your own set of seasons, weathers and challenges in your mod. More information about implementing the Seasons API in your mod can be found in this wiki:
